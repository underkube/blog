# What Edu is Reading This Week

People often ask me about the cool stuff I stumble upon during the week. So, I figured, why not share the links that caught my eye? So here we are.

This is inspired by some newsletters I read such as [Vermandeen's Valuable News](https://vermaden.wordpress.com/news/) or [Kube Today](https://kube.today/issues).

I'm not 100% sure if I'll be able to keep a weekly cadence; I really don't have too much free time lately, but I'll try!

I've asked Gemini to help me redacting and formatting the content by the way :) I was AI sceptic but I've been proven wrong so I'm trying to embrace it lately.
