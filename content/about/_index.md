# What is this?

Welcome fellow reader. This is yet another try to force myself ([Eduardo Minguez](https://eduardominguez.es)) to write stuff in the shape of a blog.


I've been trying to keep internal notes with tips and tricks, so I've decided
to try to publish them as an exercise to improve my writing skills and a little
bit of self promotion :)


This time I've purchased a cool domain and I will be mostly focused on write
stuff related to Kubernetes and Cloud from a 'sysadmin' point
of view (I believe on this 'devops' thing, but I'm mostly a sysadmin so...).
This doesn't mean I can post whatever I want... at the end of the day, this is
my blog, so... :)

I've already imported the old articles from my old blog [b.minwi.com](https://b.minwi.com) and configured a redirection.


Let's see how it goes!
