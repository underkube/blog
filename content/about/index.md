# What is this?

This is yet another try to force myself to write stuff in the shape of a blog.


I've been trying to keep internal notes with tips and tricks, so I've decided
to try to publish them as an exercise to improve my writing skills and a little
bit of self promotion :)


This time I've purchased a cool domain and I will be focused on write stuff
related to Kubernetes and OpenShift (Red Hat's distribution of Kubernetes,
because, as a Red Hat employee I am biased :) ) mostly from a 'sysadmin' point
of view (I believe on this 'devops' thing, but I'm mostly a sysadmin so...)


Let's see how it goes!
